\title{Function for making an object of class 'treedata'}
\usage{
  make.treedata(tree, data, name_column = 0)
}
\arguments{
  \item{tree}{An object of class 'phylo'}

  \item{data}{A data frame or matrix}

  \item{name_column}{The column of \code{data} that
  contains the names to be matched to the tree. By default,
  it is set to 0, which indicates row names.}
}
\value{
  An object of class "\code{treedata}". The tree is pruned
  of tips not represented in the data, and the data is
  filtered for taxa not in the tree. The data is returned
  as a data frame tble that is compatible with \code{dplyr}
  functions.
}
\description{
  This function generates an object of class 'treedata'
  that ensures that the ordering of tip labels and data
  remain intact. The object can be manipulated using
  \code{dplyr} functions.
}
\examples{
data(anolis)
td <- make.treedata(anolis$phy, anolis$dat, name_column=1)
}
