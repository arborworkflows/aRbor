\usage{
plotContrasts(tree, dat, cex.tip.label = 0.5, label.offset = 0.02,
  legend = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A tree of class 'phylo'}

\item{dat}{A named vector of continuous phenotypic data}

\item{cex.tip.label}{The character expansion factor for tip labels}

\item{label.offset}{The relative amount the tip labels are offset from the tips of the tree}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plot.phylo}
}
\description{
Function for plotting contrast values
}
\details{
Phylogenetic independent contrasts are calculated at each node and plotted on the phylogeny,
the value of of the absolute contrast is converted to a color scale. In addition, the relationship between
node age and contrast value is plotted and a linear fit to the relationship between absolute contrast
and the age of the node (The node-height test). Under BM the relationship should be 0.
