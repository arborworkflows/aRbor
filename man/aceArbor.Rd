\title{Reconstructing ancestral states of discrete and continuous characters}
\usage{
aceArbor(td, charType = "continuous", aceType = "marginal",
  discreteModelType = "ER", na.rm = "bytrait")
}
\arguments{
\item{td}{An object of class 'treedata'}

\item{charType}{specifies the type of character, either:
\describe{
        \item{"discrete"}{a character with a discrete number of states}
        \item{"continuous"}{a continuously varying character}
        \item{"fromData"}{will attempt to determine the data type from the data itself; DO NOT USE YET!}
    }}

\item{aceType}{specifies the method used to reconstruct ancestral character states:
\describe{
        \item{"marginal"}{marginal ancestral state reconstructions, which reconstruct each node integrating over all possibilities at all other nodes in the tree; this is typically the method used in the literature to reconstruce ACEs}
        \item{"joint"}{joint ancestral reconstructions, which give the configuration of ancestral states that together maximize the likelihood of the data given model parameters}
        \item{"mcmc"}{reconstruct ancestral states using Bayesian MCMC. Note that the discrete version of this doesn't seem to work, and even if it did work it is not a full MCMC ancestral state method}
        \item{"stochastic"}{create stochastic character map}
    }}

\item{discreteModelType}{One of ER, SYM, or ARD; see geiger's fitDiscrete for full description}

\item{na.rm}{How to deal with missing data.
\describe{
      \item{"bytrait"}{Drop species out trait-by-trait}
        \item{"all"}{Drop out species that have NAs for any trait}
    }}
}
\description{
This function returns ancestral state estimates using a variety of methods
