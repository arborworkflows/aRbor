\title{Function for calculating phylogenetic signal of discrete and continuous traits}
\usage{
physigArbor(phy, dat, charType = "fromData", signalTest = "pagelLambda",
  discreteModelType = "ER")
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{A tree of class 'phylo'}

\item{dat}{A named vector of continuous or discrete data}

\item{charType}{The type of data being analyzed. Defaults to "fromData" which detects
data type, but may be forced to either "continuous" or "discrete"}

\item{signalTest}{The type of test used to detect phylogenetic signal, either "pagelLambda", "Blomberg", or "garbageTest"}

\item{discreteModelType}{The type of model used to fit discrete character evolution for the garbageTest, either "ER", "SYM", or "ARD"}
}
\description{
This function allows testing either Blomberg (for continuous), Pagel lambda (for both), or "garbage test" (for discrete)
}
